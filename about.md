From January 2024 to April 2024, I (Kunvar) will be working to mechanistically understand the out of context meta-learning phenomena that occurs in large language models (llms). 

This is a collaborative effort. I want to thank my teammates for all the work they did, helping resolve the confusions about how LLMs perform meta-learning out of context.
